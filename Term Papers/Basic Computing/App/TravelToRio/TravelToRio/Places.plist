			<string>Rocinha (little farm) is the largest favela in Brazil, and is located in Rio de Janeiro&apos;s South Zone between the districts of São Conrado and Gávea. Rocinha is built on a steep hillside overlooking Rio de Janeiro, and is located about one kilometre from a nearby beach. Most of the favela is on a very steep hill, with many trees surrounding it. Almost 70,000 (census 2010) people live in Rocinha, making it the most populous favela in Brazil. Although Rocinha is officially classified as a neighbourhood, many still refer to it as a favela. It developed from a shanty town into an urbanized slum. Today, almost all the houses in Rocinha are made from concrete and brick. Some buildings are three and four stories tall and almost all houses have basic sanitation, plumbing, and electricity. Compared to simple shanty towns or slums, Rocinha has a better developed infrastructure and hundreds of businesses such as banks, medicine stores, bus lines, cable television, including locally based channel TV ROC (TV Rocinha), and, at one time, a McDonalds franchise. These factors help classify Rocinha as a favela bairro, or favela neighborhood.</string>

It is located on top of the Santa Teresa hill, by the centre of Rio, and is famous for its winding, narrow streets which are a favourite spot for artists and tourists. The neighborhood originated around the Santa Teresa Convent, built in the 1750s on the Desterro hill. At the end of the 19th and early 20th century it was an upper class borough, as testified by its many opulent villas. Santa Teresa ceased being an upper-class neighbourhood long ago, but it has been revived as an fashionable otspot. It is home to several artists and art studios and galleries. The offer of restaurants and bars is also varied. One of Santa Teresa&apos;s most illustrious inhabitants was Raymundo Ottoni de Castro Maia, an art collector who lived in his Chácara do Céu mansion in the neighborhood. The estate was turned into a museum (Museu da Chácara do Céu) and its exhibits include works by Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Eliseu Visconti, Di Cavalcanti, and Candido Portinari. It is located near the cultural center Parque das Ruínas. In 2006, some paintings were stolen, and haven&apos;t been recovered yet. Another museum is the Museu do Bonde, which tells the history of the famous Santa Teresa Tram since its historic origins. A ride on the tram is a popular attraction among tourists. It sports crossing the old Carioca Aqueduct, going through picturesque streets of the Santa Teresa neighbourhood and wonderful views of the city downhill.</string>

			<key>Description</key>
			<string>Jardim Botânico (English: Botanical Garden) is a residential neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, located north of Ipanema and Leblon, just across Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas and east of Gávea. Jardim Botânico lies in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The district got its name as it grew around the city&apos;s Botanical Garden. The residents are generally upper-middle to upper class and do not live near a favela, which is rare in the city. It differs from most of Rio&apos;s neighbourhoods due to the large number of large detached houses, again not that common in the densely populated south zone. It is home to many Brazilian celebrities and the headquarters of the nationwide television network, Rede Globo. Many of Rede Globo&apos;s studios are in the neighbourhood. The main road in the borough is the Rua Jardim Botanico (Jardim Botanico Street). The neighborhood leads to Rio de Janeiro&apos;s large Tijuca Forest, using a road that winds up through the mountainous forest. One of Rio de Janeiro&apos;s most famous carnival blocs parades annually through the streets of Jardim Botanico. The bloc calls itself &quot;Suvaco do Cristo&quot;, which translates to &quot;Armpit of the Christ&quot; because Jardim Botânico lies underneath the right armpit of Rio de Janeiro&apos;s most prominent landmark, Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) statue.</string>
